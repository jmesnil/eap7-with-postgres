# Generate an Helm chart for the application

* Due to a [bug](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts/issues/773) in Red Hat OpenShift Helm registry, the process to generate the Helm chart for the application needs to be edited:

* in `Chart.yaml`, edit the name of the 3 dependencies:

```
- name: redhat-eap74
  ...
- name: redhat-postgresql-imagestreams
  ...
- name: redhat-postgresql-persistent
  ...
```

* Run `helm dep up`
* Revert the change in `Chart.yaml` to remove the `redhat-` prefix:

```
- name: eap74
  ...
- name: postgresql-imagestreams
  ...
- name: postgresql-persistent
  ...
```

* Run `helm package .`

At this point, the generated archive can be used to install the whole application:

```
helm install eap7-with-postgres eap7-with-postgresql-1.0.0.tgz
```
